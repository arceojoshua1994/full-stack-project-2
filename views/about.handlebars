            <p>
                Recipeasy was founded in 2023 by Joshua Arceo and Juan Galvez in Miami, Florida.
                Our mission is to teach people how to cook a plethora of recipes from all around the world, regardless of age or background.
                We believe that cooking is an essential life skill that brings people together and allows
                for creativity and self-expression.

                their favorite recipes, discover new ones, and connect with a community of passionate
                home cooks. Whether you're a seasoned chef or just starting out, Recipeasy is here to
